## Introduction

Useful main principles:

* Signal that this is Språkbanken Text: 
  * use the logo
  * use the orange color
  * use the Jost* font
  * write "Språkbanken Text" not "SB" or "SBX"
  * add our URL: spraakbanken.gu.se
* Keep it simple - less is more

In the work with our templates we have tried to mimic, or at least been inspired by, existing templates from the University of Gothenburg.
